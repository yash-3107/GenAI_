No-Code/Low-Code Intelligent Assistant Builder
This project aims to provide a user-friendly web application for building intelligent assistants using OpenAGI, an open-source toolkit for creating autonomous agents. The application empowers users to visually design workflows by connecting pre-built components for OpenAGI's agents, large language models (LLMs), and tools. By leveraging these components, users can create their own intelligent helpers to simplify tasks and achieve their goals.

Features
Drag-and-Drop Interface: Intuitive UI allows users to easily design workflows by dragging and dropping pre-built components onto a canvas.

Integration with OpenAGI: Seamless integration with OpenAGI's toolkit enables access to agents, large language models, and other tools required for building intelligent assistants.

Workflow Execution Engine: Efficient execution engine interprets and executes workflows designed by users, handling data flow between components and invoking OpenAGI's APIs.

User Authentication: Secure user authentication mechanism ensures authorized access to the application, supporting username/password and third-party authentication providers.

Workflow Management: Users can save, load, and share their workflows, as well as manage their accounts and permissions within the application.

Architecture
High-Level Design (HLD)
User Interface (UI): Provides a drag-and-drop interface for workflow design and includes features for saving, loading, and sharing workflows.

Backend Architecture: Manages user authentication, workflow execution, and integration with OpenAGI's toolkit using a server-side application.

Integration with OpenAGI: Accesses OpenAGI's APIs to interact with agents, large language models, and other tools for building intelligent assistants.

Workflow Execution Engine: Interprets and executes workflows designed by users, handling data flow between components and invoking OpenAGI's APIs.

Scalability and Performance: Designed to be scalable and performant, supporting a large number of users and concurrent workflow executions.

Low-Level Design (LLD)
User Authentication: Implements secure user authentication using tokens and supports third-party authentication providers.

Workflow Design Interface: Features a canvas-based interface for visually designing workflows, with configurable component properties.

Backend API Endpoints: Exposes RESTful API endpoints for managing user accounts, workflows, and executing workflows.

Workflow Execution Flow: Interprets workflows, traverses the workflow graph, and executes each component in the correct order, with error handling and logging.

Security Considerations: Implements input validation, access control mechanisms, and HTTPS encryption to protect user data and application integrity.

Getting Started
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Install dependencies: npm install
Configure environment variables: Create a .env file with required environment variables.
Start the server: npm start
Access the application at http://localhost:3000
